# Attitude Estimation Exame - Hexagon

by Klaus Edward Becker Begnis

## Task development

The task consisted of developing an algorithm that reads values from a log file with data aquired from a accelerometer.

The accelerometer in question is the [MMA8451Q](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MMA8451Q.pdf). When the data were aquired, the accelerometer was setted in the 8*g* configuration, this configuration reflects directyly into the sensibility factor from the reading performed, as Table 1 shows.

#### Table 1		
|---------------|-------------------|
| Configuration | Sensitivity       |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 2*g*          | 4098 [*counts/g*] |
| 4*g*          | 2048 [*counts/g*] |
| 8*g*          | 1024 [*counts/g*] |

### Calulating pitch and roll

The values obtained reflected acceleration values in a 3-axis system. To convert this values and discover the roll and pitch values in degrees, the subsequent [article](http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN3461.pdf) was followed.

Summarizing the calculations needed to process these information are presented at Equation 1-4, and each variable is presented at Table 2.
